In the paper, **type** and **token** refer to different levels of linguistic analysis for the **noun compounds (NCs)** used in the study:

1. **Type**: This refers to the general category or class of a word or expression. For example, the type-level compositionality score is assigned based on how idiomatic or compositional a noun compound is in general, without considering its specific use in a sentence. It's a broad evaluation of the expression's potential idiomaticity.

2. **Token**: This refers to a specific instance or occurrence of a word or expression in a sentence. For example, the token-level compositionality score is assigned based on how idiomatic or compositional a noun compound is in a given sentence. This evaluation takes into account the actual context in which the noun compound appears.

In short, **type** is more abstract and general (looking at the expression as a whole, independent of context), while **token** focuses on the specific instance or usage of the expression in a sentence. 

The paper uses both levels of annotation to provide a more granular understanding of how well models capture idiomaticity, both in the abstract sense and in context.
